                <h4>Personality Prediction System</h4>
                <p style="text-align: justify">A web-based personality prediction system that utilizes machine learning techniques to predict an individual's personality traits based on their
                    online behavior. The system collects data from Twitter platforms, and applies natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to
                    generate a personality profile for each user. The prediction results are displayed on a user-friendly website, allowing individuals to learn more
                    about their own personality and how it may affect their interactions with others. Additionally, the system can be used by organizations to better
                    understand the personalities of their employees and customers, potentially leading to improved communication and productivity. Overall, our webbased personality prediction system offers a convenient and accurate way to understand and predict personality traits.
